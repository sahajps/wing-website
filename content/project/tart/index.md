title: TART – An Open-Source Tool-Augmented Framework for Explainable Table-Based Reasoning

summary: A framework integrating LLMs with external tools to enhance explainability and accuracy in table-based reasoning tasks.
abstract: "Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle with table structures and precise numerical reasoning, which are crucial for tasks such as table question answering (TableQA) and table-based fact verification (TableFV). To address these limitations, we introduce the **Tool-Augmented Reasoning framework for Tables (TART)**, which integrates LLMs with specialized tools to enhance explainability and reasoning accuracy. TART consists of three components: (1) a **Table Formatter** to ensure structured table representation, (2) a **Tool Maker** to generate task-specific computational functions, and (3) an **Explanation Generator** to maintain human-interpretable reasoning. Additionally, we introduce **TOOLTAB**, a new dataset benchmark tailored for training LLMs in table–tool integration. Our results demonstrate that TART achieves significant improvements over standard Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting, achieving near-parity with GPT-3.5-turbo when paired with **CodeLlama**."

TART is designed to overcome the **limitations of LLMs in table reasoning** by combining **structured table processing, precise tool execution, and explainability**. The key components of TART are:

1. **Table Formatter**: Prepares tables by formatting, aligning, and cleaning the data for structured input.
2. **Tool Maker**: Dynamically generates tools (Python functions) tailored for complex table operations.
3. **Explanation Generator**: Integrates structured reasoning steps and tool outputs into human-readable explanations.

TART is evaluated on **nine table-based reasoning benchmarks**, including **SCITAB, TabFact, FinQA, and HybridQA**. The framework consistently outperforms Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting by integrating structured tool-assisted reasoning.

TART has received the **Best Paper Runner-Up Award** at the [3rd Table Representation Learning Workshop](https://table-representation-learning.github.io/NeurIPS2024/) at NeurIPS 2024 and has been accepted at **NAACL 2025**. Its code and dataset are publicly available for further research. Researchers working on LLM explainability, table reasoning, and AI-assisted fact-checking are encouraged to contribute.
